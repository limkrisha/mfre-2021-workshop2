# Overview of steps

- Access the data from Statistics Canada using {cansim} package
- Do some data cleaning
- Create static and animated graphs

---

# {cansim} package

[Jens von Bergmann](https://twitter.com/vb_jens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) created an R package called [{cansim}](https://github.com/mountainMath/cansim) that connects to the Statistics Canada API and retrieves data tables. 

Today, we will work with this table: [Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, provincial, and territorial, annual (x 1,000,000), Table 36-10-0222-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610022201) 

The code to get this table into R is `get_cansim(cansim_number)`, which in our case will be `get_cansim(36100222)` 

---

# {cansim} package

```{r cansim_sample, eval = F}
gdp_can_sample <- get_cansim(36100222) %>% filter(GEO == "Canada" & REF_DATE == 2019) %>%
  select(REF_DATE, VALUE, Prices, Estimates)
```

.pull-left[
![](pics/gdp_cansim_sample.png)
]

.pull-right[
![](pics/gdp_cansim_statscan.png)
]

---

# {cansim}

Let's download this data and use the [`normalize_cansim_values()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cansim/cansim.pdf) to "set all units to dollars instead of millions"

```{r accessgdp_show, message = F, warning = F}
gdp <- get_cansim(36100222) %>% normalize_cansim_values() 

glimpse(gdp)
```

---

# Writing a function

- Create a vector of Canadian provinces called `provlist`
- Write a function called `short_provs()` that will take in a data frame as an argument and create a new variable called `geo_short`, which is a 2 letter abbreviation of the province name for the provinces of interest 

```{r prov_function}
provlist <- c("British Columbia","Alberta","Saskatchewan","Manitoba","Ontario",
              "Quebec", "New Brunswick","Nova Scotia","Prince Edward Island",
              "Newfoundland and Labrador")

short_provs <- function(df){
  df <- df %>%
    filter(GEO %in% provlist) %>%
    mutate(geo_short = case_when(
      GEO=="British Columbia" ~ "BC",
      GEO=="Alberta" ~ "AB",
      GEO=="Saskatchewan" ~ "SK",
      GEO=="Manitoba" ~ "MB",
      GEO=="Ontario" ~ "ON",
      GEO=="Quebec" ~ "QC",
      GEO=="New Brunswick" ~ "NB",
      GEO=="Prince Edward Island" ~ "PE",
      GEO=="Nova Scotia" ~ "NS",
      GEO=="Newfoundland and Labrador" ~ "NL"
    ))
  
  df$geo_short <- factor(df$geo_short,
                         levels=c("BC","AB","SK","MB","ON",
                                  "QC","NB","PE","NS","NL"))
  
  df
}
```

---

# GDP by Province

- Create a `year` variable that stores `REF_DATE` variable as numeric
- Filter observations 
- Select relevant columns only

```{r gdp_mutate}
df_gdp <- gdp %>%
  mutate(year=as.integer(REF_DATE)) %>% 
  filter(GEO %in% provlist,
         Prices=="Chained (2012) dollars",
         Estimates=="Gross domestic product at market prices") %>%
  select(GEO, year, gdp = VALUE)
```

---

# Tidy Data

- Is the data tidy?
- Does one variable occupy one column in the data frame? 

---

# Using the function

- Create a new variable called `geo_short` using the `short_provs()` function we specified earlier
- Clean the variable names using `clean_names()` function

```{r accessgdp, message = F, warning = F}
df_gdp <- short_provs(df_gdp) %>%
  clean_names()
  
head(df_gdp)
```

---

# Let's start graphing!

```{r plotgdp, out.width = '500px', out.height = '400px'}
plot_gdp <- ggplot(df_gdp, aes(geo_short, gdp/1e9, 
                               fill = geo_short, label = geo_short)) +
  geom_col()

plot_gdp
```

---

# Let's start graphing!

- Let's add
  - Add province abbreviation to the bars
  - Change color scale to [viridis](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html), which looks great plus can be viewed by people with common forms of color blindness
  - Change y axis labels to dollar value
  - Use [`theme_tufte()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggthemes/versions/3.5.0/topics/theme_tufte) - no border, no axis lines, no grids
  - Remove x axis labels 
  - Add labels

```{r plotgdp2, eval = F}
plot_gdp <- plot_gdp +
  geom_text(vjust = -0.1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar) + 
  theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family = "Roboto") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}", x = "", y = "GDP (2012$ billions)")

plot_gdp
```

.pull-right[
Why does the labels look ugly? 

Took me a while to figure it out

- This is time series data, so labels repeat itself 
- One solution would be to add a `check_overlap = T` argument inside `geom_text()`, but only plots a snapshot
- Another solution would be to summarize and plot the average GDP.

# GDP per capita

- Yay we have an animated graph!
- But provinces have different sizes, so it would be better to do GDP per capita
- Let's pull the annual population data ([Table 17-10-00501](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)) from Statistics Canada and merge it with our GDP data

```{r pop, warning = F, message = F}
pop <- get_cansim(1710000501) %>% normalize_cansim_values()

df_pop <- pop %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(REF_DATE)) %>%
  filter(GEO %in% provlist,
         Sex=="Both sexes",
         `Age group`=="All ages") %>%
  dplyr::select(GEO, year, pop=VALUE) %>%
  clean_names()

df_gdpcap <-left_join(df_gdp,df_pop, by=c("year","geo")) %>%
  mutate(gdpcap=gdp/pop) 
```

---

# Let's graph it!

```{r merge, eval = F}
p_gdpcap <- ggplot(df_gdpcap, aes(geo_short, gdpcap, 
                                  fill = geo_short, label = geo_short)) +

  transition_time(year) +

# GDP per capita - extra cool

What if we get the provinces to rank themselves every frame? 

We first have to create a ranking variable

```{r createrank}
df_ordered <- df_gdpcap %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(prov_order = rank(gdpcap))

```

---

# GDP per capita - extra cool

Let's plot the graph and also flip the bars horizontally too

Use `geom_tile` instead of `geom_col` because it works better with the frame transitions

```{r plotrank, eval = F}
p_rank <- ggplot(df_ordered,
                        aes(prov_order, group = geo_short, color= geo_short, fill=geo_short)) +
  geom_tile(aes(y = gdpcap/2, 
                height = gdpcap,
                width = 0.9), alpha = 0.9) +
  # text on top of bars
  geom_text(aes(y = gdpcap, label = geo_short), hjust = -0.4) +
  # text in x-axis (requires clip = "off" in coord_cartesian)
  geom_text(aes(y = 0, label = geo_short), hjust = 1.4) +
  coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = FALSE) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name="")+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name="")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar)+
  theme_tufte(14,"Roboto")+
  guides(color=F,fill=F)+
  labs(title='{frame_time}', x = "",y="GDP per capita ($2012)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 22),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y  = element_blank()) + 
  transition_time(year)+
  ease_aes('cubic-in-out')

animate(p_rank, nframes = 100, fps = 5, end_pause = 20) 
```

# Data Visualization Hierarchy

**Can I trust the data?**

Then ask:

2. Am I *responsibly* communicating the story of the data?
3. Is it *clear* for the audience I'm trying to reach?
4. Does it look *awesome*?

# A note on pie charts

**IF** you decide a pie chart is a good option,

- Ask: Are the main takeaways clear? Are proportions different enough to notice quickly and easily?
- Avoid a ton of wedges
- Aggregate groups if there are many tiny slices (e.g. "Rest of the World")
- Emphasize one group by highlighting or having it "pop-out"
- Label directly
- **Always compare to a bar chart** version to see which makes the data story clearer for your audience

# A note on stacked bars 

[Cleveland and McGill (1984)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400 ) conducted an experiment on graphical perception. We already know that pie charts can be difficult for humans to read. They found that stacked bar charts have even higher reading error rates. 

They can be useful if your point is to "show that a value is the sum of other values, but you are only interested in comparing the totals." 

Hard to compare groups that don't start at the same baseline

- This is a problem because connecting lines **imply** that there are possibilites that exist between nodes, and that is often not the case. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/fauxtrend.png")
```

# Faux trends

- If you ever add a line or trend, try to explain the meaning of the **slope** of any line segment. 

- If you can't explain it to yourself clearly, the audience does not even have a chance and will often cause more confusion or misinterpretation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/fauxtrend2.png")
```

# Remove distractions

- 3D effects - does not add value to your chart
- Overuse of bright and bold colors - Use softer color tones except where you want to draw attention

# Emphasize the important part

After you arrange your plots in a meaningful order, highlight the series/levels that you want the audience to focus on.

# Customize Legends

Default legends are usually not ideally placed and often not in helpful order

A better strategy:
- Consider moving the legend
- Label directly in an order that matches the data
- Use helpful visual cues (e.g. color or pattern matching)

# Do the details

- Use superscripts / subscripts and correct symbols
  - $3.4E+4$ vs $3.4 \times 10^4$
  - km^2 vs km<sup>2</sup>
  
- Be thoughtful of significant figures / decimal points

- Resolution matters

- Spend time with fonts and color schemes
